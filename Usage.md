#Usage

##Installation
????????????????????

##Placing and moving dots
- Click in the bounds of the field to place a dot. It will be automatically selected.
- Click on an existing dot to select it.
- Click and drag a dot to move it.
	- When clicking and dragging, right-click to cancel the move.
- Right-click a dot to delete it.
- Right click any empty space to deselect the currently selected dot.

##Editing dots
The "Dot Data" pane on the right side of the screen contains controls for the selected dot.
Controls:
- Instrument
	- Select a letter from A-Z. This will be displayed above the dot on the page.
- Number
	- Select any number 1 - infinity. This will be displayed above the dot on the page.
- X Position
	- Changed by clicking and dragging point as explained [above](../master/Usage.md#placing-and-moving-dots). Also editable with the controls.
- Y Position
	- Changed by clicking and dragging point as explained [above](../master/Usage.md#placing-and-moving-dots). Also editable with the controls.
- Position Text
	- Not editable. Displays the position of the dot in English.
	
Notes:
- The instrument and number combined make the dot "name". Duplicate names are allowed technically, although it doesn't make much sense from a marching standpoint. Telling someone to be in two places at once is a bit evil, even for a band director.

##Editing the page
The "Page Data" pane on the right side of the screen contains controls for the entire page.
- Navigation
	- Pages are shown in the format:
	
		> \<Page Number> | \<Song Title>, m.\<Starting Measure>-\<Ending Measure>
	- Select a page to display that page. You don't need to save the page you're working on before you do this, but it never hurts.
- Page Number
	- Just shows the page number... You didn't really have a question about this one, right?
- Song Title
	- Edit the song title here and watch as it magically updates the navigation box and text box.
- Starting Measure
	- ^
- Ending Measure
	- ^
- Counts
	- ^
- Notes
	- Write whatever you want. It will be shown in the text box.
- Text X Position
	- Move the text box horizontally.
- Text Y Position
	- Move the text box vertically.
- Clear Page
	- Remove all dots from the page. **Does not save automatically, so if you somehow managed to do this accidentally, just close without saving and re-open.**
- Delete Page
	- Remove this page and change the number of other pages to remove the hole. Band directors hate holes. **Does not save automatically, so if you somehow managed to do this accidentally, just close without saving and re-open.**
