????????????????????

##Placing and moving dots

- Click on an existing dot to select it.
- Click and drag a dot to move it.
	- When clicking and dragging, right-click to cancel the move.
- Right-click a dot to delete it.
- Right click any empty space to deselect the currently selected dot.

##Editing dots
The "Dot Data" pane on the right side of the screen contains controls for the selected dot.
Controls:
- Instrument
	- Select a letter from A-Z. This will be displayed above the dot on the page.
- Number
	- Select any number 1 - infinity. This will be displayed above the dot on the page.
- X Position
	- Changed by clicking and dragging point as explained [above](../master/Usage.md#placing-and-moving-dots). Also editable with the controls.
- Y Position

Notes:
- The instrument and number combined make the dot "name". Duplicate names are allowed technically, although it doesn't make much sense from a marching standpoint. Telling someone to be in two places at once is a bit evil, even for a band director.
